### Question 4

Plot the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ for $x \in [-2, 2]$.

```{r}
x = runif(1000,-2,2)

x = seq(-2,2,length = 10000)

y = sin(x)

plot(y~x,type = "l")
```

### Question 5

```{r}

install.packages("car")
library(car)

#Values from t-distribution 
tvals = rt(1000, 1)

#Sorting sample dataset 
tvalsSorted = sort(tvals)

#Quantiles from normal distribution 
qsTheory = quantile(rnorm(1000),probs = seq(0.01,0.99,0.01),names = F)

#Quantiles from sample distribution 
qsSample = quantile(rt(1000,1),probs = seq(0.01,0.99,0.01),names = F)

plot(qsSample~qsTheory)


qqPlot(tvals, envelope = 0.95, ylim = c(-5, 5))

```
