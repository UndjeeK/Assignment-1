### Question 1

Displaying flights data set

```{r}
flights |> glimpse()
```

### Question 2

```{r}
flights
flights1x = flights |> filter(month == 1) %>% group_by(carrier) |> summarise(mean_dist= mean(distance),sd_dist = sd(distance)) |> arrange(mean_dist,sd_dist)
flights1x
```

### Question 3

```{r}
flightYV = flights |> filter(carrier == "YV") |> filter(month == 1) |> distinct(distance)
flightYV
```

Standard deviation for YV is 0 because all the distances are equal to 229 as shown in the code below

```{r}
flightOO = flights |> filter(carrier == "OO") |> filter(month == 1)
flightOO
```

Standard deviation for OO is NA because there is only one observation where carrier is "OO" and the month = 1.
